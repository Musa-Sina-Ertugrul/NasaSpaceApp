# Creating New AI Tools And AI Arthitechture for Agriculture

## Introduction

The impact range of agriculture grows exponantialy as expected due to growth on human population. Also , during that growth another field called ai continues own growth and affects human life directly or non directly so, we think agriculture need take its own slice of pie from ai. Therefore, we collected data from settialites, made data analysis, invented new ai architecture, proved mathematicaly new architecture and visualized data to help continue better futures with farmers.

## How Can I Access the Data You Use?

These are the coordinates of the cropfields in and around Manisa Celal Bayar University. These coordinates also include the villages of Shamar and Yagcilar, so it is a suitable location for our project.
``
Lat: 38.70105 Lng: 27.22785 - Lat: 38.649866 Lng: 27.328137 
``


If you want the check EO Browser yourself you can paste it the this geometry and see where we working on it

```
